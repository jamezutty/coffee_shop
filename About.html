      <h4 class="w3-center "style="font-style:italic">Tradition since 1889</h4>
      <p class="w3-large">The Coffee Beans was founded  by Mr. Smith in Los Angles, Although a mocha is often interpreted differently across the world, the basis is that a shot of espresso is combined with a chocolate powder or syrup, followed by milk or cream. It is a variant of a latte, in the sense that it is often 1/3 espresso and 2/3 steamed milk. However, a chocolate flavour is added, and this can be milk or dark ingredients.</p>
